                    Assignment One: As We May Think

                    I went into this article not knowing what to expect, and so was initially very confused about the perspective.
                    I probably should've noticed the fact that it was from 1945, but it was almost more interesting to go in blind.
                    It discussed topics such as science, photography, and data collection and management in such archaic terms, and
                    imagined improvements that already currently exist. It was actually interesting to listen to the author parse
                    through the improvements of their time. To us now, both the author's view of what is old technology and what
                    is new technology is so outdated that it's not something we really consider. However, for the author, it is such
                    a novice concept to be able to do things such as "dry photography" and being able to compress Encyclopedias into a few
                    pages. The way in which he imagines possible improvements for the future and almost takes humor in it the same way we
                    do with concepts like flying cars is such a sobering experience. It really puts into perspective how quickly and
                    suddenly we can evolve and innovate and what an impact it has on us. Things that were once considered jokes are now
                    accepted as completely normal and we continue to come up with and implement further advancements that get more and more
                    complex as we figure out how to compress and delegate the once time-consuming tasks to machines of our own making. It
                    really gets you thinking about what the next generation's new "norm" will be.
